 Set the `requiresParent` and `allowedChildren` attributes for components **WHERE IT MAKES SENSE**. Some would benefit from a `requireParent`, some from `allowedChildren`, some from both, and some from none. Not everywhere does it make sense, and usually not in the main/featured components, it's usually a sub-component like `RadioGroup` that needs one of these rules, not `Radio`. See for example, in the case of `RadioGroup` we need to set an `allowedChildren` property that lets only `Radio` elements. For other components, it could allow multiple types of children not just one. Now let's see the `Radio` component. Does it make sens to add a `requiresParent` rule to it? No, because a `Radio` can be correctly (and logically) placed as the child of any componnet. `Select` for example should only be let to contain `Option` elements, and `Option` elements should require a `Select` parent. This is how you think about it.
